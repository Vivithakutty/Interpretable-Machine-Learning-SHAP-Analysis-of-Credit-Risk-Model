Advanced Time Series Forecasting with State Space Models and Kalman FilteringOverviewThis repository contains a comprehensive implementation of advanced time series forecasting techniques using State Space Models (SSM) and the Kalman Filter. The goal is to provide an alternative to the classical ARIMA approach by modeling time series with underlying latent states representing trends and seasonal components, and estimating these states using the Kalman Filter.The project demonstrates:Programmatic generation of synthetic time series data with deterministic trends, multiple seasonalities, and Gaussian noise.Implementation of a State Space Model representing local linear trend and seasonal components.Development of the Kalman Filter algorithm for state estimation.Parameter estimation using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm within the state space framework.Forecasting and comparison against a baseline SARIMA model using RMSE, MAE, and MAPE metrics.Analysis of the calibration and uncertainty quantification of prediction intervals.Clean, modular Python code suitable for production use.BackgroundStandard models like ARIMA often struggle with complex non-stationarities and multiple seasonal patterns. State Space Models offer a flexible framework where the observed series is linked to unobserved states evolving over time, which can incorporate trend and seasonality explicitly. The Kalman Filter provides an optimal recursive estimator for these latent states when observed data are noisy.Repository Contentsnotebook.ipynb: Google Colab-ready notebook implementing data generation, Kalman Filter, EM parameter estimation, forecasting, and comparison.README.md: This document.(Optional directories for data, scripts if expanded.)InstallationThis project requires Python 3 with the following packages:numpymatplotlibpandasscipystatsmodelsInstall dependencies with:pip install numpy matplotlib pandas scipy statsmodelsFor an interactive environment, Google Colab can be used directly with this notebook.UsageOpen notebook.ipynb in Google Colab or Jupyter.Run the notebook cells sequentially to:Generate synthetic time series data.Build and estimate the State Space Model via Kalman Filter and EM.Generate forecasts and baseline SARIMA forecasts.Evaluate and visualize prediction accuracy.Modify parameters such as seasonal period, noise variances, and forecast horizon in the notebook to experiment with different setups.Key Functions and Classesgenerate_synthetic_data: Creates a synthetic time series with known latent states.construct_ssm_matrices: Defines State Space transition and observation matrices.KalmanFilter: Class implementing the Kalman Filter prediction and update steps.EM_algorithm: Runs EM iterations to estimate unknown noise variance parameters.state_space_forecast: Produces multi-step forecasts using the fitted State Space Model.sarima_forecast: Provides baseline forecasts with SARIMA for comparison.compute_metrics: Calculates RMSE, MAE, and MAPE for forecasting evaluation.ResultsForecasts from the State Space Model are compared to SARIMA on a holdout test set.
